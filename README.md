## Yuri Mataev's Resume

It all started when I was updating my resume, and became frustrated with the limitations of word processors... What started out as simply an attempt to switch everything over to HTML/CSS quickly snowballed into something completely over-the-top.

The resume is written with React and SCSS, and comes with a complete test suite written with Jest, Enzyme and ESLint. Its home on the web is [https://resume.mataev.com]. Deployment to this location is achieved with the help of a CI/CD pipeline built using GitHub Actions.

I still have no rational explanation for doing this, other than: it was fun!
